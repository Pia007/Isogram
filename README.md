## Overview

### The Project

Isogram Checker

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. This application accepts a user's input and evaluates whether or not it is an isogram. Additionally, if the input does not fit the criteria for evaluation, the user is prompted to try again. Note: The input automatically clears after 2.5 seconds.
