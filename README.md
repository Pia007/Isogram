## Overview

### The Project

Isogram Checker

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. This application accepts a user's input and evaluates whether or not it is an isogram. Additionally, if the input does not fit the criteria for evaluation, the user is prompted to try again. Note: The input automatically clears after 2.5 seconds.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- JavaScript
  - String Methods
  - Array Methods
  - Document Object Model
  - Regular Expressions
  - For Loops
  - Conditional Operators
  - Template Literals
- CSS3


### What I learned

As simple as this app may seem, it was challenging to implement a function that evaluates the input based on certain conditions prior to actually evaluating whether the input is an isogram or not.  I learned to how to create functions that used a combination of string & array methods, regular expressions, loops, conditional operators, template literals and DOM maipulation.
